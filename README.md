Inspired from [NetHack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetHack), fwod is a roguelike, turn-based, dungeon crawling game.

Based around the early 1990s, one day, you wake up in a mysterious bunker 

fwod is Mono compatible.

Nightly builds are available [here](http://cdn.skildust.com/osp/fwod/nightly/), by the thanks of my girlfriend, @sKiLdUsT.
