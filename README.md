Inspired by [NetHack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetHack), fwod is a roguelike, turn-based, dungeon crawling game with user-friendly controls and randomly-generated floors.

Based around the early 1990s, one day, you wake up in a mysterious bunker.

fwod is Mono compatible.

fwod is currently in the **Development Phase**.

Nightly builds are available [here](http://cdn.skildust.com/osp/fwod/nightly/), by the thanks of @sKiLdUsT.

## Notes
